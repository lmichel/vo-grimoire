I'm a space scientist working on star formation my\nfield of expertise is ultraviolet astronomy (www.nuva.eu). I'm the Spanish\nPI to the next UV mission: WSO-UV (www.wso-uv.org).\n\nI was involved in VO matters back in 2002-2004 when the scientific\nrequirements for VO were being defined, FPV  (at that time, it was the AVO)\nand I'm involved in the dissemination of scientific knowledge in the\neducational system for target ages 14-17 (Secondary-High School).\nI lead the Spanish HOU project (www.houspain.com) and we are part of  the\nEU-HOU initiative (www.euhou.net) and the Galileo Teacher Training Program\n(GTTP).  I've got involved in this mailing list through the EUHOU-MW\nproject; we are running a set of radiotelescopes for education in Europe\nled by our colleagues at Paris (IAP). Mario (Ramella) attended the last\nmeeting of the EUHOU-MW consortium in Paris\nand we agreed to feed our data into edu-IVO.\n\nNow, my comments:\n\n1. The flagging system is defined in terms of the professional system; you\nassume that a given school actually carry out the observations perfectly.\nHowever, our experience is that even being guided, occasionally, when the\nSchools or students operate without the direct supervision of a scientist,\nthey get \"peculiar results\". These results are valuable from the\neducational point of view and are part of the learning process. There\nshould be some flagging in this sense within the archive.\n\n1b. A flagging system associated with subject and target age is highly\ndesirable for the educational resources you may plan to plug into the\nsystem (take a glance to www.houspain.com/gttp  for a possible approach\n(our approach) to the problem)\n\n2. Language. In the educational system English is not as widespread as in\nthe scientific environment. We keep having to translate documents,\napplications to all EU languages within EU-HOU. My question is, could VO\nnodes take over the task  of translating some core documents?.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nCheers, Ana\n\nProf. Ana I G\u00f3mez de Castro\nUniversidad Complutense de Madrid\nAEGORA Research team\nwww.mat.ucm.es/~aegora\n\n\n\n\n2014-02-25 15:03 GMT+01:00 <edu-request@ivoa.net>:\n\n> Send edu mailing list submissions to\n>         edu@ivoa.net\n>\n> To subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit\n>         http://www.ivoa.net/mailman/listinfo/edu\n> or, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to\n>         edu-request@ivoa.net\n>\n> You can reach the person managing the list at\n>         edu-owner@ivoa.net\n>\n> When replying, please edit your Subject line so it is more specific\n> than \"Re: Contents of edu digest...\"\n>\n>\n> Today's Topics:\n>\n>    1.
